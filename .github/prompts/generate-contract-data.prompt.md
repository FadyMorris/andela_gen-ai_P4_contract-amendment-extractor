Generate two LaTeX documents for the contracts, the  original contract as #file:original.tex     and the amended contract as #file:amendment.tex .  
The amended contract is the same as original with extra amendments.  
Describe the amendments in the #file:README.md   Markdown file.   
Do not describe the amendments in the amended contract itself.
